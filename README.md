# IBDsims

This repository contains code for running simulations with 
admixed genomes. This code was created for to work described in 
Morrison, Jean (2013). “Characterization and correction of error in genome-wide ibd estimation for samples with population structure”, Genetic Epidemiology 37.6, pp. 635–641.

As of August 2017, it has been several years since I have tested this code. If you run into problems please let me know and I will try to help.
